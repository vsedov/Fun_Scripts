Projects from Impractical python projects : playful programming activities to
make you smarter

## Layout
  - Each chapter will be listed with questions that i think are fun or something
    that i can learn from . I will not do all the questions but those that
    i deem hard or somewhat interesting to do .
  - If there is something new that i found out , i will create a ipython file on
    that given topic such that it will be easy for me to come back to it and to
    make sure that i understand it .
  - I will try to do the extended questions if they are fun
  - Feel free to correct my versions of the code , sometimes i know it might not
    be the best method, always strive to improve on things that i did not know
    before.
  - I will also try following the psuedo code and try creating my own method and comparing it .
